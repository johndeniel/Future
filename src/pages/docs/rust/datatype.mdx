# Rust Data Types

Rust is a statically-typed language, which means that the data type of a variable is known at compile time. Here's an overview of some fundamental data types in Rust:

## 1. Primitive Data Types

### 1.1 Integer Types

Rust supports both signed and unsigned integers with various bit sizes.

- `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`: Signed integers.
- `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`: Unsigned integers.

### 1.2 Floating-Point Types

- `f32`: 32-bit floating-point.
- `f64`: 64-bit floating-point.

### 1.3 Boolean Type

- `bool`: Represents either `true` or `false`.

### 1.4 Character Type

- `char`: Represents a single Unicode character.

## 2. Compound Data Types

### 2.1 Tuples

Tuples are ordered lists of fixed-size elements. Each element can have a different data type.

```rust
let tuple: (i32, f64, char) = (42, 3.14, 'a');
```

### 2.2 Arrays

Arrays have a fixed size and all elements must have the same data type.

```rust
let array: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

## 3. References and Pointers

### 3.1 References
References allow you to refer to a value without taking ownership of it.

Immutable reference:

```rust 
let x = 42;
let reference = &x;
```

Mutable reference:

```rust
let mut y = 10;
let reference_mut = &mut y;
```

### 3.2 Pointers

Rust has raw pointers (`*const T` and `*mut T`) that are similar to C pointers.

```rust
let x = 42;
let raw_pointer: *const i32 = &x;
```

## 4. Custom Data Types

### 4.1 Structs

Structs allow you to create custom data types by grouping variables.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

let origin = Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 };
```

### 4.2 Enums
Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible values.

```rust
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}
```

### 4.3 Option Type
The `Option` type is often used to represent either a value or nothing.
```rust
let maybe_value: Option<i32> = Some(42);
```
