# Overview

Rust is a modern programming language known for its focus on performance, reliability, and safety. Originally developed by Mozilla, Rust has gained popularity for its unique features that address common programming pitfalls. One standout aspect is its ***ownership*** system, which enables fine-grained control over memory safety without sacrificing performance. This system, along with the borrow checker, helps prevent common programming errors like ***null pointer*** dereferences and data races.

Rust is often used in systems programming, where low-level control over hardware is crucial. Its syntax is similar to C++, but Rust introduces a novel approach to memory management, ensuring memory safety without the need for a ***garbage collector***.

The language also emphasizes a **"zero-cost abstractions"** philosophy, allowing developers to write high-level code without compromising runtime efficiency. Rust's thriving ecosystem includes a package manager called Cargo, fostering easy code sharing and dependency management.

## Data Types

Data types are classified into two main categories: primitive types and compound types. Primitive types include integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters, while compound types encompass arrays, tuples, and structs, providing a strong and statically-typed foundation for building efficient programs.

<br/>

### Primitive Data Types

Rust supports both signed and unsigned Integer with various bit sizes.

- `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`: Signed integers.
- `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`: Unsigned integers.

Floating-Point Types

- `f32`: 32-bit floating-point.
- `f64`: 64-bit floating-point.

Boolean Type

- `bool`: Represents either `true` or `false`.

Character Type

- `char`: Represents a single Unicode character.

<br/>

### Compound Data Types

**Tuples** are ordered lists of fixed-size elements. Each element can have a different data type.

```rust
let tuple: (i32, f64, char) = (42, 3.14, 'a');
```

**Arrays** have a fixed size and all elements must have the same data type.

```rust
let array: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
**Slices** are references to contiguous sequences of elements in a collection. They are declared using the `&` operator on an array.

```rust
// Create an array
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Create a slice from the array
let slice: &[i32] = &array[1..4];

// Print the slice
println!("{:?}", slice);
```

<br/>


### References and Pointers

References allow you to refer to a value without taking ownership of it.

```rust 
// Immutable Reference

let x = 42;
let reference = &x;
```

```rust
// Mutable Reference

let mut y = 10;
let reference_mut = &mut y;
```

Rust has **raw pointers** (`*const T` and `*mut T`) that are similar to C pointers.

```rust
let x = 42;
let raw_pointer: *const i32 = &x;
```

<br/>


### Custom Data Types

**Structs** allow you to create custom data types by grouping variables.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

let origin = Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 };
```

**Enums** allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible values.

```rust
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}
```

The **Option** type is often used to represent either a value or nothing.
```rust
let maybe_value: Option<i32> = Some(42);
```
