# Monorepo vs Polyrepo

## Monorepo (Mono Repository)

- In a monorepo, all the source code for multiple projects or components of a software system is stored in a single repository.
- This includes libraries, services, applications, and any other code artifacts.
- Monorepos provide a centralized and unified version control system for all code.
- Changes across different projects can be managed atomically, ensuring consistency and compatibility.

## Polyrepo (Poly Repository)

- In a polyrepo, each project or component has its own dedicated repository.
- Each repository is independent and contains the source code, configuration, and other related files for a specific project.
- Polyrepos are associated with a more decentralized and distributed approach to version control.
- Developers working on different projects have more autonomy and flexibility in managing their codebases.

### Advantages and Considerations:

#### Monorepo:

- **Code Sharing:** Easier sharing of code and libraries among projects.
- **Atomic Changes:** Changes that span multiple projects can be committed atomically.
- **Consistency:** Easier to enforce consistent coding standards and dependencies.

#### Polyrepo:

- **Isolation:** Projects are more isolated, reducing the impact of changes in one project on others.
- **Autonomy:** Teams can work independently with their own workflows and tools.
- **Flexibility:** Developers can choose different version control systems for different projects.

### Use Cases:

#### Monorepo:

- Large organizations with many interdependent projects.
- Projects with shared libraries and components.
- Continuous integration and deployment setups.

#### Polyrepo:

- Smaller organizations or projects with simpler dependencies.
- Projects with diverse technologies or language preferences.
- Teams that value autonomy and independence.

Both monorepos and polyrepos have their advantages and are suitable for different scenarios. The choice between them often depends on factors such as the size and structure of the development team, the complexity of the projects, and the desired level of control and consistency across codebases. There is ongoing debate in the software development community about which approach is preferable, and the decision often comes down to the specific needs and goals of the organization or project.
