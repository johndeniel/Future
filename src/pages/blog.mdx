2. **Add your Android App to the Firebase Project:**

   - In the Firebase Console, click on "Add app" and select Android.
   - Enter your app's **Package name** (usually in the format `com.example.myapp`) and click **Register app**.
   - Paste the SHA-1 fingerprint from your project in the appropriate field.
   - Download the `google-services.json` configuration file.

3. **Add `google-services.json` File:**

   - Copy the downloaded `google-services.json` file to your `app` module's root directory.

4. **Enable Google Sign-In**

   - In the Firebase Console, navigate to the "Authentication" section.
   - Click on the "Sign-in method" tab.
   - Enable the "Google" sign-in provider and save your changes.

5. **Enable Real-Time Database:**

   - Choose the "Real-Time Database" option.
   - Set up your database rules and configure the database according to your app's needs.
    ```json
    {
      "rules": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": true
      }
    }
    ```

6. **Enable Storage:**

   - In the Firebase Console, navigate to the "Storage" section.
   - Set up your storage rules and start using Firebase Storage to store and manage your app's files.

    ```firebase
    rules_version = '2';
    service firebase.storage {
      match /b/{bucket}/o {
        match /{allPaths=**} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
